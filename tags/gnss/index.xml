      <description>&lt;p&gt;To deploy the autonomous robot into reality,  where the robots have to cope with complicated and challenging environment, it is a tendency that fusing multi-sensor data to achieve the goal. Besides, the calibration, time synchronization and computation complexity should also be came into considered. This projects introduced a loose-coupled framework that fuses IMU, SLAM, GNSS and other sensors separately, which tolerates single sensor failure during operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm allowed each sensor to separately estimate their own pose, and conducted the relative-absolute relationships, for example the IMU-SLAM or SLAM-GPS. Then it would apply an error-state Kalman Filter to optimize the independent poses from SLAM and IMU, and fed back into the nominal states to acquire the genuine pose.  In this process,  the rigid constraint between the local world and vision frame should be loosed since the gravity gradually calibrate the frame into the gravity-alignment coordinate. After that, A second error-state filter was utilized to fuse the GNSS measurements to prevent state estimation drift in long-term operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, this algorithm synchronization strategy is to interpolate single sensor measurements to the closest state in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High-accuracy GNSS Positioning on Portable Smartphone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google released Android Nougat (version 7.0) in 2016, which opens the possibility to use raw data to achieve high precision  solutions on low-cost smart devices. Due to the poor performance of the low-cost antenna and crystal oscillator of smartphone,  the accuracy of traditional single point positioning can only reach about 10 meters. However, IMU, the interoceptive sensor which never care about the interference outside, enable to assit GNSS to achieve robust and continous localization.  Therefore, this project aimed to develop an algorithm which achieved high-accuracy and reliable positioning of smartphones under complex environment using GNSS-IMU fusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed an Android application to obatin the raw GNSS chips data and parsed it into generic format RINEX 3.02. During the analysis, we found that phone horrible oscillator existed intermittent 256ns drift. Then the pseudorange double-difference (PDD) was perforemd to eliminate the atmosphere, satellite, and phone clock error, as well as decoupled the pseudorange and velocity measurements based on the short-baseline hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the joint heading estimation using Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) and GNSS Doppler was also presented, the result showes that this algorithm calibrated the PDR gait length loss and heading drift in the long-term, and maintained high smooth and accuracy in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;

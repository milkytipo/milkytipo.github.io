Besides, the calibration, time synchronization and computation complexity should also be came into considered. This projects introduced a loose-coupled framework that fuses IMU, SLAM, GNSS and other sensors separately, which tolerates single sensor failure during operation.\nThe algorithm allowed each sensor to separately estimate their own pose, and conducted the relative-absolute relationships, for example the IMU-SLAM or SLAM-GPS. Then it would apply an error-state Kalman Filter to optimize the independent poses from SLAM and IMU, and fed back into the nominal states to acquire the genuine pose. In this process, the rigid constraint between the local world and vision frame should be loosed since the gravity gradually calibrate the frame into the gravity-alignment coordinate. After that, A second error-state Kalman filter was utilized to fuse the GNSS measurements to prevent state estimation drift in long-term operation.\nIn addition, this algorithm synchronization strategy is to interpolate single sensor measurements to the closest state in the queue.\n","date":1585063774,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585063774,"objectID":"3335cc34180e2a32cea0cf77e3a3c6c2","permalink":"/project/msf-project/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T23:29:34+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/msf-project/","section":"project","summary":"Introduced a loose-coupled framework that fuses IMU, SLAM, GNSS and other sensors separately, which tolerates single sensor signal lost during operation.","tags":["SLAM","GNSS","IMU","sensor fusion"],"title":"Multi-sensor Fusion for Inspection Robot","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Traditionally, mobile robot often realized docking action with help of RFID or QR code.

If so, the cost of cm-grade positioning would dramatically decrease. Therefore, this project aimed to realize accurate Bluetooth signal arrival-of-angle (AOA) estimation (less than 5-degree), using single channel 6-antenna array.\nThe Multiple Signal Classification algorithm (MUSIC) on phase and frequency was performed to estimate angles. On frequency analysis, we found that there was a tricky phase drift problem caused by antenna switch would disturb the whole sampling result. We solved this problem by intermittent sampling with frequency compensation, and enlarging the switch time to divide the whole points into three patches which deleted points around switch time. The multipath effect was mitigated by antenna dynamic signal polarization switch.\nAs a result, the algorithm achieved 5-degree accuracy in estimating the AOA of Bluetooth signal, which means cm-grade localization accuracy could be achieved with this system.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6f9e4ecd3454c39ae3bc77e4782e0692","permalink":"/project/aoa-project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/aoa-project/","section":"project","summary":"Aim to realize accurate Bluetooth signal arrival-of-angle (AOA) estimation, using single channel 6-antenna array.","tags":["Bluetooth 4.0","AOA","MUSIC"],"title":"Bluetooth Indoor Positioning System","type":"project"}]
